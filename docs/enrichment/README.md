# Data Enrichment
Frakture processes a lot of standard data enrichment

## [Attribution](attribution/ "Attribution")
Attribution is assigning credit for a transaction to a message (email, Facebook post, etc).

## [Source Code Pipeline](pipeline "Source Code Pipeline")
The source code pipeline provides a sequence of automatic and human based tools to improve source coding, and extract useful information for reporting.

## [Attribution vs Source Code reporting](attribution/reporting_split "Attribution vs Source Code")
There's two major reporting structures -- one based on attributed transactions, and one based on source code performance.  Knowing what you're using is important.
