# Data Enrichment
After pulling and standardizing data, Frakture adds value to that data through our enrichment processing.

## [Conversion methods](enrichment/conversions "Conversion overview")
There are many ways to track conversions, here we discuss a few, and why we at Frakture heavily lean on source code based attribution.

## [Attribution](enrichment/attribution/ "Attribution")
Attribution is assigning credit for a transaction to a specific message.  Learn how Frakture uses source code attribution to calculate effective cross channel performance.

## [Source Code Pipeline](enrichment/pipeline "Source Code Pipeline")
The source code pipeline provides a sequence of automatic and human based tools to improve source coding, and extract useful information for reporting.

## [Attribution vs Source Code reporting](enrichment/attribution/reporting_split "Attribution vs Source Code")
There's two major reporting structures -- one based on attributed transactions, and one based on source code performance.  Knowing what you're using is important.
